#ex 2 :Instructions:Create a class called Dog.
#In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height.
 #This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
#Create a method called bark that prints the following string “<dog_name> goes woof!”.
#Create a method called jump that prints the following string “<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!”. x is the height*2.
#Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog’s name is “Rex” and his height is 50cm.
#Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
#Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog’s name is “Teacup” and his height is 20cm.
#Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
#Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.

#It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
#Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as
# it isn’t already in the list.
#Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
#Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course
# the animal needs to exist in the list.
#Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
#Example:: "Ape",
  #  B: ["Baboon", "Bear"],
  #  C: ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
  #  E: ['Eel', 'Emu']
#Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.
#Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.
#Tip: The zookeeper is the one who will use this class.
#Example:Which animal should we add to the zoo -->  girafe x.add_animal(
